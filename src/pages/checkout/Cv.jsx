                        Specializing in natural sciences throughout my school years,
                        I have earned numerous achievements and awards that reflect
                        my logical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
                        After three years of studying and working in business and economics,
                        I developed a strong interest in the application of information systems
                        in business management. This led me to pursue a career as a developer,
                        where I can fully leverage my logical thinking and self-learning abilities.
                        Following a period of intensive self-learning and training
                        in Web Development—both at home and at university—I am now
                        confident and eager to encounter and tackle real-world
                        challenges to broaden my horizons and sharpen my skill set.
